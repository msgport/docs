# Cross-Chain Tokens Management

Msgport's cross-chain functionality opens up a multitude of token management possibilities for applications. It allows issuers on either the source or target chains to set up and establish cross-chain bridge mappings for their tokens. Moreover, it acts as a utility for custodian issuers to launch Custodian DApps, which permit users to transfer the supported mapped tokens across different chains.

For example, the [XToken](https://xtoken.helixbridge.app/) leverages Msgport to streamline the process of issuing tokens on a target chain subsequent to securing the original token on the source chain, and also manages the unlocking process on the target chain following the burning of the xToken.
