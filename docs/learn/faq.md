## Which networks are currently supported by the Msgport?

To find out which networks are currently compatible with the Msgport, you can view the list of supported networksÂ **[here](../build/networks.md)**. The Msgport core team is actively working to expand this list and connect additional networks. Keep an eye on updates to stay informed about new integrations.

## What are the network requirements to support Msgport?

The primary requirement for a network to support the Msgport is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility. This is because the Msgport protocol operates entirely on smart contracts that are built for the EVM environment.

## How is the cross-chain message fee is calculated?

The msgport interfaces operate independently of the specific messaging protocols, each of which determines the cross-chain message fee differently. For details on ORMP's fee calculation, please refer to the [ORMP Fee](./messaging-protocols/ormp.md#cross-chain-fee).
