# Overview

RingDAO is a upcoming DAO based using [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) on Darwinia Chain, intended for governing the Darwinia Chain in its next version. It is currently under development and implementation. [**RING**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-network/) will be the govenance token of RingDAO. 

## XAcount and Recovery Address

[XAcount](https://xaccount.box/) will be adopted by RingDAO for cross-chain govenance, tt is also seamlessly integrated with the Safe Modules, with which we can customized a recovery address to challange and gain the xaccount permission if it lost connection from original chain.
