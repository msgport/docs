# Overview

RingDAO is a upcoming DAO based using [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/) on Darwinia Chain, intended for governing the Darwinia Chain in its next version. It is currently under development and implementation. [**RING**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/darwinia-network/) will be the govenance token of RingDAO. 

## Cross-chain governance

[XAcount](https://xaccount.box/) will be adopted by RingDAO for cross-chain govenance, it is also seamlessly integrated with the Safe Modules, with which we can customized a recovery address to challenge and gain the xAccount permission if it lost connection from original chain.

## Other projects governed by RingDAO

* [Darwinia Chains](https://darwinia.network/)
* [XAPI](https://github.com/xapi-box)
